1. Line 12 will print out 3 because the input array we are giving it is of size 3, meaning that i will start out at 0, and get incremented once after every value in the prices array. After getting incremeneted the third time (the value is 3), the expression i < prices.length will return false because they are both equal to three, meaning it will not enter the loop again. Since i was declared with var, its scope is the entire function, meaning printing i will print the last value i was set to, 3. 
2. Line 13 prints out 150 because the last value that discountedPrice was set to was the last element in the prices array which was 300 and the discount was 50% (0.5), meaning the discounted price is 150. It is in scope for the function, so there is no error.
3. Line 14 will also print out 150 because, same as above, the discountedPrice is 150. Since final price will round the value of discounted price using Math.round and by multiplying and dividing discounted price by 100. Since it is multiplied by 100 then divided by 100, the value will stay the same and print out 150. It is in scope for the function, so there is no error.
4. This function will return the discounted prices as an array (discounted) the same size as the prices array it was given, but discounted by the amount given as the second parater to the function. However, it will not return anything when called this way because the value is not being stored and/or printed. 
5. At line 12, this function will return an error when called because we used let instead of var to declare the variable i. Since we used let, we only have access to the variable within the block instead of throughout the entire function, meaning outside of the for loop, we cannot access i. Its scope ends after the if statement, so it returns an error saying that i is not defined.
