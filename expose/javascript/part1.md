1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. This results in an error because declaring the variable with let provides the variable with block scope, and the scope of results ends after the if statement, so the rest of the function doesn't have access to the result variable. 
5. This code returns an error because you can't assign a new value to a constant variable. Constant variables cannot be reassigned, so line 9 doesn't run.
6. The code returns an error for the same reason as above since you cannot reassign a const variable. Therefore, it returns an error before line 13 can run.
